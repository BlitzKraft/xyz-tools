##CKSum Notes
640 lines, 16 bytes = 10240 bytes
last four bytes is CKSum

make sure last bytes don't have a linefeed!!!


First cksum 00 08 04 23 =  525347 d
2nd cksum = 510438


## Upload notes:
Seems to have Windows LineEndinges (\cr\lf)

## Current status:
Trying to append a checksum to a chunked file... need to figure out how to do this.


## Task List:
Create Uploader:
	Add Header if needed
	chunk into 10236 bytes + 4 byte checksum
	figure out checksum - done
