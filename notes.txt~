## Header info
; filename = composition.3w
; machine = daVinciF10
; material = default
; layer_height = 0.2
; fill_density = 0.30
; shells = 2
; speed = 45

##CKSum Notes
640 lines, 16 bytes = 10240 bytes
last four bytes is CKSum

make sure last bytes don't have a linefeed!!!


First cksum 00 08 04 23 =  525347 d
2nd cksum = 510438


## Upload notes:
Seems to have Windows LineEndinges (\cr\lf) (yup)

First command with XYZ_3D@4, returns "OFFLINE_OK."
After issuing header (see below), returns "OFFLINE_OK.."
Then begins sending each chunk, printer returns "CheckSumOK:PN:0."
End of File indicated by two additional line endings (yup), followed by a checksum (yup)

Header appears as follows:
M1:MyTest,4677749,2.55.43,EE1_OK,EE2_OK         

Probably something like:
M1:<filename>,<filesize>,2.55.43,EE1_OK,EE2_OK

Further exploration reveals:
FILENAME is always MyTest
FileSize is file size, with CrLf line endings (90% sure) AND the two additional line endings
Two versions found, 2.55.43, and 1.3.49. Slicer import was 1.3.49, apparently



## Current status:
Need to write upload/parser, and also create a header before gcode

## Task List:
Create Uploader:
	Add Header if needed??
	Modify GCode with davinci comments?
	chunk into 10236 bytes + 4 byte checksum - Done
	figure out checksum - done
	Serial handler/parser
	???
